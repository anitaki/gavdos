        <li><h2>Lavrakas Beach</h2> Secluded beach on the northern coast of Gavdos, located 2 km from Agios Ioannis. About 30
            min. walk from Agios Ioannis on foot. You can go most of the way by bus from the port, but Lavrakas beach

        </li>
        <li><h2>Tripiti Beach</h2> The spectacular rock formations have given this spectacular beach its name. Unique arches
            rise from the sea. Tripa in Greek means “hole”, and you can see three arches at the end of the formation.
            The landmark of Gavdos is a giant chair standing on the top of the Tripiti formation. The chair is with its
            inscription “southernmost point of Europe” a favourite spot for tourists. All have a picture taken with
            their feet dangling from the edge of the continent.
