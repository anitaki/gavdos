                            The spectacular rock formations have given this spectacular beach its name. Unique arches
                            rise from the sea. Tripa in Greek means “hole”, and you can see three arches at the end of
                            the formation.
                            The landmark of Gavdos is a giant chair standing on the top of the Tripiti formation. The
                            chair is with its
                            inscription “southernmost point of Europe” a favourite spot for tourists. All have a picture

                            their feet dangling from the edge of the continent.
