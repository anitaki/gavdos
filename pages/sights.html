    <p>In ancient times iron was exported from Lavraka harbour, which today is to be found 3 meters under sea level. In
        the region of Agios Ioannis, just southeast of Lavraka you can see the ruins of the city built during the First
        Byzantine Period. In those days, the City of Agios Ioannis had 8,000 inhabitants and Gavdos had its own
        archbishop. Today you can see the famous chapel erected from 900 A.D.
        You will find the Folklore Museum in the village of Vatsiana and in the village of Ampelo you will have the
        opportunity to walk among the vineyards of Minoa. In Kastri, the capital of Gavdos, you can walk along
        picturesque alleys with stone houses and gardens.</p>

        back in the late 19th century by the French Company of Ottoman Lighthouses. It was one of the most visible
        lighthouses worldwide, second only to the one in the Land of Fire in Argentina. With a tower height of 14 meters
        its focal height was 360 meters.</p>
