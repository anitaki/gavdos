    <h1>Important sights in Gavdos island</h1>
    <section class="sights-general">
        <p>In ancient times iron was exported from Lavraka harbour, which today is to be found 3 meters under sea level.
            In
            the region of Agios Ioannis, just southeast of Lavraka you can see the ruins of the city built during the
            First
            Byzantine Period. In those days, the City of Agios Ioannis had 8,000 inhabitants and Gavdos had its own
            archbishop. Today you can see the famous chapel erected from 900 A.D.</p>

                <p>Near the village of Ambelos you will find the charming lighthouse of Gavdos. The original lighthouse
                    was built
                    back in the late 19th century by the French Company of Ottoman Lighthouses. It was one of the most
                    visible
                    lighthouses worldwide, second only to the one in the Land of Fire in Argentina. With a tower height
                    of 14 meters
                    its focal height was 360 meters.</p>
