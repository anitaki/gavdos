    <p>
        It is a good idea to visit Gavdos island as a part of your trip to Crete.
        Then you can allow for a day or two in Crete before your flight home. This
        is important since bad weather conditions often give delays for the boat
        connection from Gavdos.

    <h1>How to reach Gavdos island?</h1>
    <img src="../images/gavdos.jpeg" alt="aerial image of Gavdos">
    <p>To reach Gavdos Island you must go by boat from either the port of Chora Sfakion or from the seaside villages of
        Sougia or Paleochora on the southern side of Crete. Before booking accommodation in Gavdos it is important to
        check the departure schedules. Beware of sudden changes in the schedules, they happen often. The most common
        port of departure is Chora Sfakion with several weekly routes to Gavdos. You can reach Chora Sfakion by car
        crossing the White Mountains through the Gorge of Imbros. You can also travel by bus from Chania Central Station
        to Paleochora and embark a ferry boat from there.</p>
