    <p>Gavdos island has only a few villages with just about a hundred inhabitants all year round. During the summer it
        gets pretty crowdy compared to local standards. Many of the visitors are campers, but you can also rent a room
        in one of the few hotels, an apartment, or a villa with sea view.</p>
